  <div class="mahomes">Patrick Mahomes, quarter back of the Kansas City Chiefs starting in 2018. In January of 2018, Chiefs announced that they would be trading Mahomes for Alex Smith, which made Patrick Mahomes
       the starting quarter back for the Kansas City Chiefs. In his first year as starting quarterback, Mahomes took the team all the way
        to the AFC championchip game where they would ultimately lose due to a defensive foul. His second year with the Kansas City Chiefs
         would prove to be his year as he would take the team all the way to the superbowl and win it for the first time in over 50 years. </div>

  <h3>Behind The Cannons</h3>
  <p>Patrick Mahomes was born in Tyler, Texas. He was an athlete all throughout school, playing not only football but baseball and basketball as well. Patrick’s dad, Randi Mahomes was actually an MLB pitcher and it was said that Patrick would be following in his father’s footsteps with a highschool record of a no-hitter with 16 strikeouts within a single game. Patrick Mahomes was Maxprep’s “Male Athlete of the Year” for 2013-2014, and was selected by the Detroit Tigers after highschool, but did not sign up due to his commitment to Texas Tech. His freshman year at Texas Tech, Mahomes played as a backup to Davis Webb. Mahomes only really got his chance to shine after Webb took an unexpected injury, letting Mahomes take over for the rest of the season. This year he would also be a relief pitcher for the Texas Tech baseball team. Mahomes started his second year at Texas Tech as the starting quarterback. In his junior year, Mahomes said that he would no longer be playing for the baseball team, as he would be devoting all of his time to the football team and his career moving forward.  </p>
